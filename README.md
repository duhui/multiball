#Multiball
##What?

##No, really. What?
This is an attempt to do some pseudo multicast stuff with Redis. If Redis is the AK-47 of NoSQL, then... [AK-47s for everybody!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQdaEFa_60)
###Also
I don't feel nearly as comfortable with rspec as I do more traditional unit testing, so forgive if they are ugly.
